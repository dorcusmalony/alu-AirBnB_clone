##alu-AirBnB_clone



###Project Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to build a simplified version of AirBnB, starting with the implementation of a command-line interpreter. The interpreter will manage various objects related to AirBnB, such as User, State, City, and Place, using serialization and deserialization.
###Command Interpreter

##How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the console.py script.
bashCopy code
$ ./console.py
 
##How to Use
Once in interactive mode, you can use the following commands:
Help: Displays the list of documented commands.
EOF: Exits the command interpreter.
Quit: Exits the command interpreter.
Examples:
bashCopy code
(hbnb) help 
bashCopy code
(hbnb) quit 

###Non-Interactive Mode

The command interpreter also works in non-interactive mode, where commands can be provided through standard input.
Example:
bashCopy code
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
